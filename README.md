## Features

  - State of the art graphics
  - Automatic game saving when quitting. If there's a saved game it is automatically loaded, too
  - Ability to load the latest saved game
  - Ability to pause the game
  - Stats
  - Sound effects!
  - Musics!

## Prerequisites

Python 3. May eventually works with Python 2 (not tested).

## Installation

Clone this repo, and then the usual `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Usage

```
python run.py
```

### Controls

  - <kbd>ESC</kbd> closes the game
  - <kbd>PAUSE</kbd> pauses the game
  - <kbd>F1</kbd> starts a new game
  - <kbd>F2</kbd> displays stats
  - <kbd>←</kbd> and <kbd>→</kbd> moves the Tetrimino respectively to the left and to the right
  - <kbd>↑</kbd> rotates the Tetrimino
  - <kbd>↓</kbd> makes the Tetrimino to fall faster

## How it works

This game is built on top of [PyGame](http://www.pygame.org/hifi.html). I obviously can't explain how it
works here, so you'll have to jump yourself in the source code. Start with the entry point, `run.py`.

Beside the game itself, I use [PyInstaller](http://www.pyinstaller.org/) to generate the executables. It packs
up all the game and its assets in a single executable file so players just have to run it with nothing to install.
This task is performed by the `build_*` scripts to be run in the corresponding OS.

### Scoring

Each completed lines is worth 10 points. If you have completed 4 lines at once (also called a "tetris"), the score
is doubled, so (4 lines x 10 points) x 2 = 80 points. If there's no more blocks on the playground once you have removed
lines, the score is also doubled. Taking the previous example: 80 points x 2 = 160 points.

### Levels

You get to the next level every 8 completed lines. Tetriminos will fall 100 milliseconds faster for each gained
levels (they are initially falling for one block down every 1 second).
